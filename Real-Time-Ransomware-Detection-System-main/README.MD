# Ransomware Detection using Behavioral Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This is a **personal project** where I designed and implemented a behavior-based ransomware detection system.  
The system monitors and analyzes program execution patterns to identify ransomware-like activities in real time, using machine learning models for classification.

The goal of this project was to explore the intersection of **cybersecurity** and **machine learning**, and to build a scalable detection pipeline that can be integrated into enterprise security systems.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Behavioral Analysis** – Detects malicious patterns through system activity monitoring.
- **Machine Learning Classification** – Uses Scikit-learn models for accurate detection.
- **Dynamic Analysis** – Simulates ransomware execution within an isolated environment.
- **Extensible Design** – Can be integrated with other threat detection systems.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – For security teams to run scans and view results quickly.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core language for backend logic and ML.
- **Cuckoo Sandbox** – Dynamic malware analysis framework.
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model training and evaluation.
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization for threat analysis.

## 📊 Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Gathered execution logs from ransomware and benign files.
2. **Feature Extraction** – Derived behavioral indicators from logs.
3. **Model Training** – Trained classification models in Scikit-learn.
4. **Evaluation** – Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment** – Packaged the model for real-time scanning.
