# 🛡️ Real-Time Ransomware Detection System

Welcome to the **Real-Time Ransomware Detection System**! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for detecting ransomware attacks in real-time. By monitoring system activities and analyzing potential threats, the system aims to identify and respond to ransomware behaviors promptly, helping to safeguard valuable data and maintain system integrity.

## ✨ Features

- 🚨 **Real-Time Detection**: Monitors system activities to detect ransomware attacks as they happen.
- 🔍 **Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes file and process behaviors to identify suspicious activities.
- 🛡️ **Alert System**: Sends notifications when ransomware activities are detected.
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring system status and threat alerts.
- 🛠️ **Customizable Rules**: Allows users to define and adjust detection rules based on their specific needs.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🛠️ **Flask** (for handling API requests)
- 📊 **Pandas** (for data analysis)
- 📈 **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)

**Frontend**:
- ⚛️ **React.js**
- 🎨 **CSS** (for styling)

**Database**:
- 🗄️ **SQLite**
